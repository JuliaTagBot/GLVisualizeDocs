## Welcome the Documentation of GLVisualize

GLVisualize is an interactive 3D visualization library written in Julia and modern OpenGL.
Its focus is on scientific visualizations but is not restricted to it.
There are lots of 2D and 3D visualization types like particles, surfaces, meshes, sprites, lines and text.
It uses [Reactive](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Reactive.jl) to offer an easy way of animating your data.
It also offers very basic GUI elements like slider and buttons.

Please check out the examples to see what GLVisualize is capable of.
